# reddit-image-extractor

This script extracts images from Reddit image subreddits using the PRAW wrapper.

Users will first have to set your CLIENT ID, CLIENT SECRET and test agent for the PRAW wrapper in the code.

Upon running the script, users will be asked for their reddit username and password. They will then determine the subreddit from which the images should be downloaded from, the number of images and the time frame.

Time frames can be for top x number of images by:
- Day
- Week
- Month
- Year
- All Time

Once successfully run, a folder will populate with the name of the specified subreddit with all of the images in .jpg format inside.

Thank you for using this script. I just wanted to facilitate easier downloading of images so that I could swap out my wallpapers easier.

Please email any issues/bugs to farhannhrd@gmail.com
